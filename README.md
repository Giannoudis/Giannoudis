### Welcome

Experienced Microsoft developer focused on software engineering, domain-specific frameworks, and open source.

I am currently working on the open source project [Payroll Engine] (https://github.com/Payroll-Engine/PayrollEngine).

| :point_right: **Payroll Engine is a framework for developing low-code/no-code payroll solutions with a focus on automation, scalability and testability.** |
