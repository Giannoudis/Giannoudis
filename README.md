### Welcome

I have been developing with Microsoft technologies for over 30 years and specialize in business framework development. One area of my work is programming time information. 

I am currently working on the open source project [Payroll Engine] (https://github.com/Payroll-Engine/PayrollEngine).

| :point_right: **Payroll Engine is a framework for developing low-code/no-code payroll solutions with a focus on automation, scalability and testability.** |
